IRENE (rendering):

THIS WEEK:
- 20/02/2025: intersect functions for each object type (first sph and next steps, and leave it pending the plane and cylinder? add one by one?)
- 20-21/02/2025: understand what to do when hit is found and continue the code (light ratios, bouncing, shading)
- 22-23/02/2025: build first static image with at least 1 sph

week 24/02/2025: understand matrices, transl and rotations?
week 03/03/2025: optimize checking of ALL objects to find first hit? objects as a linked list according to their proximity to camera?? OR not, beause when it hits one, we have to change again the order? OR subdivide the space?


TOGETHER DECIDE:
- Use float or double (different function prototype in math library function)
- Bonus:
	- Include light color
	- Take from the scene file if we are introducing a filter??
