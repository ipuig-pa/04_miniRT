IRENE (rendering):

25/02/2025:
- normals for cyl
- start understanding matrices, transl and rotations?


- linalg funcitons, put order: use only add / sub. Use the same for points and vectors??
week 24/02/2025: understand matrices, transl and rotations?
week 03/03/2025: rotations etc
week 10/03/2025: shiny, shadows, reflection, etc

- establish tmax and tmin for ray impact (r(t) = o + td)

MORE
- include triangle intersection, so we can have complex forms represented as a meshed of triangles
- Bouncing, reflextion, refraction, etc
- Antialiasing (to smooth contours)
- optimize checking of ALL objects to find first hit? objects as a linked list according to their proximity to camera?? OR not, beause when it hits one, we have to change again the order? OR subdivide the space?

- Include functions for vector operation (add and substract without needing to do everytime in each function)

EDGE CASES:
- light inside an object (illuminated from the inside?)
- 


TOGETHER DECIDE:
- Use float or double (different function prototype in math library function)
- Bonus:
	- Include light color
	- Take from the scene file if we are introducing a filter??
