IRENE (rendering):

THIS WEEK:
- shadow hits and shading
- intersect functions for each object type
Decide if it makes more sense to do calculations of vectors/points with pointers or with the direct copy of variable (change many function parameters to const)
- Why when using 2 spheres, the smaller gets deformed. (point of view???)
- check: granulations, perimeter line on the gradient, etc?

week 24/02/2025: understand matrices, transl and rotations?
week 03/03/2025: rotations etc
week 10/03/2025: shiny, shadows, reflection, etc

MORE
- Bouncing, reflextion, refraction, etc
- Antialiasing (to smooth contours)
- optimize checking of ALL objects to find first hit? objects as a linked list according to their proximity to camera?? OR not, beause when it hits one, we have to change again the order? OR subdivide the space?

- Include functions for vector operation (add and substract without needing to do everytime in each function)

EDGE CASES:
- light inside an object (illuminated from the inside?)
- 


TOGETHER DECIDE:
- Use float or double (different function prototype in math library function)
- Bonus:
	- Include light color
	- Take from the scene file if we are introducing a filter??
