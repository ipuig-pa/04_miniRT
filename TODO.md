IRENE (rendering):

THIS WEEK:
- 20/02/2025: intersect functions for each object type (first sph and next steps, and leave it pending the plane and cylinder? add one by one?)
- 20-21/02/2025: understand what to do when hit is found and continue the code (light ratios, bouncing, shading)
Decide if it makes more sense to do calculations of vectors/points with pointers or with the direct copy of variable (change many function parameters to const)
- 21/02/2025: try to run a main with sphere
- 22-23/02/2025: build first static image with at least 1 sph

week 24/02/2025: understand matrices, transl and rotations?
week 03/03/2025: optimize checking of ALL objects to find first hit? objects as a linked list according to their proximity to camera?? OR not, beause when it hits one, we have to change again the order? OR subdivide the space?
Read about why use float or int for colors?! or 3D color?


TOGETHER DECIDE:
- Use float or double (different function prototype in math library function)
- Bonus:
	- Include light color
	- Take from the scene file if we are introducing a filter??
